# Changelog

## PACE 0.99.4

The remaining multi-platform failures were four unrelated bugs, not one.
No change to any reported quantity: breast cancer holds at 1,637 calls,
melanoma at 46 with SPP1 Macrophage\<-Tumour at -0.066840, and both
gates print numbers identical to the previous build.

- The two ambient modes are bit-identical again on every platform. Cache
  mode took its product from R’s `%*%` while streamed mode used the
  package’s own `sparse_product_csc`: two implementations of the same
  sparse product, only one of them in a translation unit this package
  sets flags on, so their agreement was a coincidence between two
  libraries rather than a property of this code – and it held only on
  x86-64, whose baseline ISA has no fused multiply-add. Both modes now
  call the core’s product, so they differ only in chunking, which is
  exact because a sparse product is column-independent. The readout
  rebuild in `.pace_mu_block()` was a third site on the same path and is
  switched over too.

- Windows no longer dies silently during the tests. Six
  `static thread_local` non-POD objects lived inside worker bodies; they
  destruct at every thread exit, this thread pool spawns and joins fresh
  threads on every call, and destroying thread-local objects inside a
  loaded library that often is a known way to lose a process on
  MinGW-w64. The scratch is now owned by the caller, one slot per
  worker, through a worker-indexed `parallel_for` overload.

- `run_isolated()` in the tests passed the child’s library path through
  `system2(env = )`, which Windows does not support for `Rscript`. It
  now writes [`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html) into
  the generated script.

- The webR build links with `--shared-memory`, which is refused unless
  every object was compiled with atomics. `-pthread` was in `PKG_LIBS`
  but not `PKG_CXXFLAGS`; `./configure` now probes it for the compile
  line as well.

- `shrink_threads` defaults to 1. The parallel shrink raised a
  BiocParallel reducer error on one supported R version that could not
  be reproduced on any other, and serial is the stream the package’s
  fixtures were made with. Raise it when a large cohort’s shrinkage is
  the bottleneck.

- The test suite names the running file and test on stderr. R installs
  its SIGSEGV handler on Unix-alikes only, and `R CMD check` keeps the
  last few lines of block-buffered stdout, so a Windows crash previously
  pointed at a test that had already finished. stderr is unbuffered and
  survives the kill.

## PACE 0.99.3

- The portability tolerance from 0.99.2 was set at 1e-12, which is below
  the noise floor of the quantity it gates: these are sums over ~7,900
  cells, and n \* eps is 1.7e-12. aarch64 failed at 2.8e-12. Raised to
  1e-10, the gate the rest of the suite already uses.

## PACE 0.99.2

Portability fixes found by Bioconductor’s multi-platform builders. No
change to any reported quantity: breast cancer holds at 1,637 calls,
melanoma at 46 with SPP1 Macrophage\<-Tumour at -0.066840.

- Fused multiply-add is now suppressed by a compiler flag rather than by
  pragmas. `#pragma GCC optimize("fp-contract=off")` is a documented
  debugging aid that does not reliably override GCC’s default, and
  `gene_solve.cpp` – the solver – never included the header at all, so
  contraction was live there even on macOS. `./configure` probes the
  compiler and writes `-ffp-contract=off` into `src/Makevars`, leaving
  it empty where the flag is rejected. This took all six platforms from
  failing to x86_64 passing.

- Comparisons between the compiled core and the R it replaces are made
  at a tolerance rather than bit for bit where the quantity is a
  REDUCTION – the kernels, the ambient field, the linear predictor’s Z
  sum. A reduction’s accumulation order is the compiler’s to choose, and
  AVX and NEON choose differently; aarch64 failed at 1e-15 where x86_64
  passed. Shapes, names and which entries are zero must still match
  exactly.

- The frozen fixtures – the IRLS digests and the pinned dispersion
  values – run on the machine that froze them and skip elsewhere. They
  compare against stored constants, and `exp`, `log` and `lgamma` are
  not bit-identical across libm implementations, so no compiler setting
  can make them portable.

- The shrinkage tests pin `shrink_threads = 1`. The default is 4, and on
  a platform without `fork()` the shrinkage says so in a message that
  arrived before the one the tests assert on, failing every Windows
  build.

## PACE 0.99.1

Correctness fixes from an internal audit of the fitting engine. All of
these produced wrong numbers with no error raised. The analyses in the
accompanying manuscript were produced with the pre-fix engine and were
checked to be unaffected.

Reported output is unchanged. On the shipped breast cancer subset the
shrunken slopes move by at most `1.6e-06` and the local false sign rates
by `3.2e-05` across all 17,792 (gene, focal, neighbour) rows, with the
same 60 calls at `lfsr < 0.05`, no flipped calls, and no sign changes.
The raw solver output moves at the `1e-04` level, and moves *towards*
the full-double reference (fixed effects `8.4e-04 -> 5.3e-05` from it),
because the ridge no longer drops into single precision. Every other fix
is exactly reproducing: with the precision guard disabled the refit is
identical to 0.99.0 (`max|diff| = 0`).

### Correctness fixes

- An `NA` in any random-effect variable no longer corrupts the design
  matrix. [`model.matrix()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/model.matrix.html)
  drops such rows, which left the sparse assembly recycling covariates
  so that cells received other cells’ values; this now stops with a
  message naming the column and the number of rows dropped.

- The condition interaction term is derived from `condition_col` instead
  of a hardcoded `"Responder"` prefix. Cohorts whose condition column
  had any other name silently produced an all-zero condition indicator,
  and therefore an identically zero responder spatial block, while the
  output looked complete. A `resp_term` that names no level of
  `condition_col` is now refused.

- Standard errors are computed on every iteration, so a fit that exits
  early at convergence no longer returns all-`NA` `se_B`/`se_U` (which
  the shrinkage layer then discarded). Convergence on a float interior
  takes one further pass in double so the retained standard errors are
  not float-quantised.

- Non-finite genes are counted and reported instead of being masked out
  of the convergence metric, and a fit that has lost genes is no longer
  reported as converged. In the streaming engine the NaN repair is
  re-checked after it runs, and genes that remain non-finite are
  reported on every iteration, including the last, where the interior is
  already double and the repair cannot help.

- The ridge is kept out of single precision. It is accumulated inside
  the float kernel, where the smallest representable increment on a
  diagonal of order `sum(w)` is `eps_float * sum(w)`; below that the
  regularisation is quantised away, at a threshold that falls as `1/n`,
  so the same model and design lose their ridge purely by growing the
  cohort. The interior is now forced to double whenever the ridge is
  small relative to the diagonal scale.

- The variance components are bounded from above by a new `tau_max`
  argument (default `100`). Every previous tau write was a `pmax`
  against a floor with no ceiling, so a column identified only by the
  ridge climbed by `mean(u^2)` per iteration while its inflated
  posterior variance fed the next update. The default sits roughly 6-30x
  above the largest component observed on healthy cohorts and just below
  `var(z)`, the variance of the working response that the components
  decompose; it does not bind on any fit in the test suite. A binding
  cap is reported, since it means the term is not identified by the
  data.

- The empirical-Bayes floor in the adaptive tau update is scaled by the
  median across genes rather than the mean, so a single runaway gene can
  no longer lift the floor for every gene in its row. The shrinkage
  target itself is unchanged.

- The per-iteration largest variance component is recorded in the fit
  history and printed alongside the block medians, since a runaway
  confined to one term does not move a median taken over the whole
  block.

- mash is now given the correlation between conditions under the null.
  The focal cell types are conditions estimated in the same per-gene
  solve, so their errors are correlated, and the previous default of
  `V = I` treated them as independent and mis-calibrated the local false
  sign rates. The estimate is taken over the conditions that vary:
  sparse focal-neighbour pairs are zeroed by the kernel drop without
  their column being removed, so those conditions have a constant z
  column, and [`cov2cor()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/cor.html) on the
  full matrix returns `NaN` for every entry. Degenerate conditions are
  left uncorrelated, which is the correct limit, and the estimate falls
  back to independence when fewer than two conditions vary. Set
  `null_correlation = FALSE` in
  [`paceShrink()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/paceShrink.md)
  to restore the old behaviour.

  On the shipped breast cancer subset the estimated correlations reach
  0.20 in absolute value, the shrunken slopes correlate at 0.9954 with
  the independent fit, and one call changes net at `lfsr < 0.05` (60 to
  61: CD163 in macrophages near tumour and PECAM1 in B cells near T
  cells gained, ERBB2 in tumour near T cells lost, all three within 0.02
  of the threshold). The 1,294 nominal sign changes are numerical noise:
  none is significant in either pass and their median absolute effect is
  4e-21.

- Leave-one-patient-out variance decomposition now subsets the
  contamination offset matrix alongside `mu`. Leaving it at full length
  offset every cell after the dropped patient’s first row, so each
  leave-one-out row was wrong while the full-data row was correct.

- The condition-by-proximity pair contributions are matched to the
  neighbours whose interaction terms are actually present, rather than
  to the first `n` entries of the neighbour list, and pair rows are
  labelled from the same matching vector. The previous indexing
  misaligned neighbour columns whenever an interaction term was missing.

- [`plotResponseCurve()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/plotResponseCurve.md)
  draws each arm’s fitted slope on the arm it belongs to. It took the
  arm carrying the responder interaction from the first level of the
  plotted factor, which is the alphabetically first one, while the
  model’s reference is the level recorded in `params$resp_term`. The two
  agree only by coincidence, so on a cohort whose arms are `"R"` and
  `"NR"`, where the model references `R` but `NR` sorts first, both
  dashed lines were drawn on, and labelled with, the wrong arm. The
  agreement was not even stable for one cohort: `"PD"` sorts before
  `"nonPD"` under `C` collation and after it under `en_US`, so the same
  call could label the figure differently on two machines, and the
  `condition` vignette exercises exactly that pair. A `resp_term` that
  does not name a level of `condition_col` is now an error rather than a
  silent guess. No fitted quantity is affected: the binned means are
  computed from the data, and the slopes, decomposition and pair
  contributions all index the coefficient matrices by explicit term
  name.

### New features

- The memory and approximation settings the fitter accepts are
  documented on
  [`paceModel()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/paceModel.md),
  under “Memory and approximation settings”. Three of them were
  reachable but undocumented: `ambient_mode`, which decides whether the
  ambient field is materialised or recomputed per chunk and is what lets
  a full transcriptome panel fit in memory; `alpha_warmup`, which
  freezes the dispersion MLE after its first few iterations and
  **defaults to 6**, so every fit already runs that approximation; and
  `alpha_max_n`, which caps the cells the dispersion MLE sees. The note
  on `alpha_max_n` records that a cap validated on two cohorts of
  roughly 10^5 cells did not hold on a 1.2M cell panel, where it left
  the number of calls unchanged while changing which calls they were.

- [`cellContamination()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/cellContamination.md)
  reports, per cell, the contamination loading `rho_i` and the fraction
  of the cell’s expected counts attributed to its local ambient field,
  `sum_g mu_spill_ig / sum_g mu_ig`. This is the quantity the solver
  already printed in its fitting trace and then discarded; both engines
  now retain it as `contam_frac`, which costs two length-`n`
  accumulators rather than the `n x G` matrices, so it is available from
  an ordinary streaming fit without `return_mu`. A high fraction marks a
  cell whose profile is largely explained by its neighbours, the
  expected signature of a segmentation or transcript-assignment error.

  Read the fraction rather than the loading. The ambient field is
  cross-cell-type, so a cell with no differently-typed neighbour inside
  the technical kernel has no ambient signal at all; its `rho_i` is
  unidentified and shrinks to the empirical Bayes prior mean, giving
  every such cell the same apparently middling loading. On the shipped
  breast cancer subset that is 4,589 of 7,898 cells, including 84% of
  the tumour cells.

- [`paceDecompose()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/paceDecompose.md)
  rebuilds the fitted means it needs instead of requiring them to have
  been stored. `mu` is a deterministic function of what the fit already
  holds: on the log scale `eta = X B + Z U` has rank at most `p + q`, so
  `B`, `U`, `X_fixed` and `re_meta$Z` are its factored form and the
  dense `n x G` matrix is the expanded copy. Only the ambient field is
  recomputed, from the counts in the `SpatialExperiment` the function
  already takes. The rebuild is exact rather than approximate:
  `max|diff| = 0` against the solver’s own matrices, and a decomposition
  identical to the stored one, across per-cell contamination and no
  contamination, edge correction on and off, a non-default technical
  bandwidth, per-image kernels, a condition cohort, and a non-
  alphabetical cell-type order.

  `technical_offset_mat` is rebuilt alongside `mu`, not as a detail: it
  gates the spillover block, so rebuilding only `mu` leaves a
  decomposition that reports no spillover without raising anything. On
  the packaged fit that is a block with a median of 1.6% and a maximum
  of 46%.

  The ambient field is rebuilt from the settings the fit recorded, never
  from the defaults of the exported
  [`ambientField()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/ambientField.md),
  since a fit made with another bandwidth, image grouping, cell-type
  order or edge correction would otherwise be handed a different field
  and return plausible, wrong numbers.
  [`paceModel()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/paceModel.md)
  now records `edge_correct`, the one such input that was not already
  kept; a fit made before this is refused rather than rebuilt on a
  guess.

  A fit can therefore be saved without its `n x G` matrices and still be
  re-decomposed. Dropping them takes the packaged example fit from 59.8
  MB to 7.1 MB in memory and 1.03 MB on disk. Note that this saves
  storage, not peak memory: the matrices are still materialised while
  the decomposition runs.

- A second vignette covers condition-stratified cohorts: what
  `condition_col`, `kernel_per_image` and `image_re` do, the responder
  spatial state block in the decomposition,
  [`pairVariance()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/pairVariance.md)
  /
  [`plotPairHeatmap()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/plotPairHeatmap.md)
  with `block = "responder"`, and the gene-level responder slopes.

  It runs on a new shipped subset of the CosMx melanoma cohort of Dong
  et al. (<doi:10.5281/zenodo.14708000>, CC-BY-4.0). The subset keeps
  every cell and every patient of the published cohort, 56,274 cells
  across 26 sections, and reduces only the panel, to the 180 most widely
  detected genes. File size is cells times genes, and of the two it is
  the cells that have to be preserved: the model reads local
  neighbourhoods, and the condition effect is a between-patient
  contrast. Cropping cells was tried first and abandoned, since at 15%
  of each section nothing reached `lfsr < 0.05` at all and no cell-based
  crop under about 5 MB recovered the result.

  The vignette therefore computes the melanoma finding rather than
  citing it: macrophage *SPP1* responds less steeply to tumour proximity
  in progressive disease, `-0.0663` with an `lfsr` of 0, the second
  strongest responder call in the fit.
  `inst/scripts/make-mel-cosmx-subset.R` records the derivation.

  The reduced panel leaves estimates alone but shifts mash’s
  calibration, which the vignette says: 76 responder calls here against
  46 on the full panel, and SPP1 at `-0.0663` against `-0.0668`. Below
  about 150 genes a focal type runs out of genes to decompose and
  [`paceDecompose()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/paceDecompose.md)
  fails, so the panel cannot be cut much further.

- Three plotting additions for condition cohorts, ported from the code
  behind the manuscript’s melanoma figures.

  [`plotProximity()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/plotProximity.md)
  gains a `condition` argument, dodging one box per arm within each
  proximity bin instead of pooling the arms. `TRUE` uses the fit’s own
  `condition_col`.

  [`plotResponseCurve()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/plotResponseCurve.md)
  draws the population view: binned means and standard errors per arm,
  with the PACE slopes overlaid as dashed lines read from the fit rather
  than smoothed from the points. Its x axis is the model’s own
  covariate, the Gaussian kernel density, so the slope is drawn on the
  scale it was estimated on.

  [`plotResponseMap()`](https://ecool50.github.io/PACE/reference/plotResponseMap.md)
  gives the spatial view for one exemplar section per arm: a
  neighbour-density kernel map with the focal cells coloured by
  expression, above expression against density with a fitted line.
  Colour and axis scales are shared across arms so the panels are
  comparable.
